1: Complete binary tree
2: Array representation of Complete Binary tree
3: What is heap
4: How value is inserted in heap
5: How value can be deleted from heap

***Complete binary tree
-> Before last level every level must be fullfil witg node
and in last level msut fill from left to right

In heap after interting one element the full array becomes sorted.
if we do it without using heap the complesity will be (N^2logN)
But, if we wue heap the complexity will be only (logN)
