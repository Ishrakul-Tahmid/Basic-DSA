1: Known about Stack and when and where it is used.
2: Implementation of Stack using Dynamic Array
3: Implementation of Stack using List
4: Implementation of Stack using Doubly Linked List
5: Known about STL Stack library.

*** Stack operation actually LIFO(Last In Forst Out)
Real Life application of stack:
When we enter a website ex: google
Then by google we enter a website like phitron; 
in this case phitron pust at the top. 
If we click back button then phitron is poped from the top of the staack.

**Stack is known as ADT(Abstract Data Structure or higher lavel).
*Array, Linked List is Lower Lavel Data Level Data Structure.
*Stack is not a new data structure; 
rather it is based on other data structure like or and linked List


*Here we do not use satatic array, cz, after deleting tail it's memory do not removed
Singly linked list do not use, cz, it's complexity O(N)
So, we use doubly linked list(actually we use list which works like doubly linked list)

*Here we implement push, pop, top, empty and size operation 
*** List is a build in library of doubly linked list
**Stack has it's own library which works internally like doubly linked list
