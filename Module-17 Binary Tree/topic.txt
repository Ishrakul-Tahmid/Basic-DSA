1: Discuss about Tree and Binary Tree
2: How Binary Tree is implemented
3: Discuss different Trevarsal Order
4: Pre Order, Post Order, In Order Trevarsal


*Top Node is known as root Node
*Every Node can have maximum two children
*Node which have no children known as leaf.

* Normal tree is known as N-ary tree(means Node can have any number of limited children)
*Array, Linked List known as Linear data structure
*Tree known as Non Linear data structure

*In binary tree printing is done according to some Order
***Order are two types
i) Defth
ii) Level
*Defth is mainly divided into three types
i) Pre Order
ii) Post Order
iii) In Order

*Pre Order: Root->Left->Right
*Post Order: Left->Right->Root
*In Order: Left->Root->Right
