1: Know about queue and application of queue.
2: Implement queue by Singly Linked List
3: Implement queue with List
4: Implement queue by doubly linked List
5: See STL queue library
6: Solve some stack and queue related question.


***Queue internally  works in FIFO(First In First Out).
*For deleting fitsr element int the array element the complexity is O(N)
But, singly and doubly need O(1).
That's why we do not use array in queue.

*Array is not good for queue.
Cz, it creates a circular queue which creates bad complexity.
Cz, after deleting head frond will go forward and new value added in the head posotion.
